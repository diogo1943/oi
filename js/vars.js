The name Just the Wind came from a Magic the Gathering™ card with the same name. The card name comes to show a moment where we ask “what was it?” and respond with: “nothing, just the wind”.</p><p>This first issue is about humanity and its next stages, how to evolve a society and how we could reach the pinnacle of the human condition. The human being as the center of all the universe, or the possibility that of not ever being...</p><p>With the Wind and the Storm, we want to create a blur between the real insignificance and the insignificance of the real, revealing the big picture as a drama but always keeping in mind that, like it says in the card’s flavor text, “There’s nothing to worry about”.</p>",

        text: '<p>In the post-digital era, reality and fiction have been diluted. The expression of this lack of definition isn’t limited to just creative and artistic endeavours, but is often weaponized by various power structures, whether formal or informal. This instrumentalization deconstructs core values such as democracy, individual and collective identity, ethnicity, and other fundamental principles of our society.</p><p>Before this current and ‘desirable’ identity crisis, design always worked with and for reality. Its objects belong, circulate, and (re)construct reality. The frailty of the majority of communication design objects also contributes to this idea of a practice that ‘serves’ the present. In short, the inevitable shock with reality defines the social status of design. If ‘design and reality’ is a (false) truism, design and fiction might appear to be an improbable hypothesis. In the face of historical, legitimized practices — such as literature or cinema — design now reclaims its place in fiction.</p><p>At the end of another cycle of study in communication design at the Lisbon Faculty of Fine-Arts, we have gone over the dilemmas, the contradictions and the themes that pertain to contemporaneity. Through the projects produced this year, the students have either commented, critiqued or essayed reality, or turned it into fiction. We’ve steered very close to cinema, literature, mythology, but also to the hard truths of a reality that insists on presenting itself, suprising us, and deconstructing itself before our eyes.</p><p><a class="proj_links" target="blank" href="http://ittakesseveralminutes.belasartes.ulisboa.pt/">→ Project Website</a></p>',

The project is motivated by a renewed interest in fiction, within artistic practices and design in particular, as one of the discursive modes that is best able to restore a sense of reality in an age governed by post-truth. Within this context, the newspaper, as one of the media that most evidently suffered the effects of disinformation, becomes prone to appropriation and recuperation.</p><p>By creatively exploring this publishing model in crisis, The Daily Post-Truth proposes the development of a newspaper, while focusing on the tensions between truth and post-truth, fiction and reality. “The Daily Post-Truth” uses fiction as the basis for a speculative and critical design practice that seeks to question the tenets of the dissemination of disinformation in the post-truth era. The newspaper was developed in a four-day workshop at maat in January 2021, coordinated by António Nicolas, Luísa Ribas and Sofia Gonçalves, with students of the master’s degree in Communication Design: Abel Quental, Beatriz Pinta, Diogo Lourenço and Madalena Lopes.</p><hr><p class='note'>Note: Unfortunately, due to my family members catching COVID-19 I wasn't able to physically be present in the last two days of the workshop.

Fortunately, somehow, I did not test positive during the time my family was infected and no person, although sick, got armed during this time.

        text: "<p>The goal with this livery trio was to bring the world of motorsport closer to the digital world. The design was made to give the impression of the cars breaking into the world of gaming, with their bright colors and glitch-like patterns. The liveries were divided by layers, the first bringing up the more functional aspect of the cars with lines emphasizing the aero lines as well as other functional details and the second bringing up the digital motifs. The vibrant colors used on the cars where chosen to evoke the RGB color system, which is commonly associated with the gaming world, but also has a parallel to the CMYK color system, traditionally used in printed matter, reflected in the usage of the registration marks and the crop outlines, functioning as a bridge between the physical and the digital universes.</p><p>Each car was given a livery that could best reflect its own character. The 599 (yellow), given its more emposing and classical silhouette gives a nod to the Italian fashion scene with its pin-striped hood, while the 488 GT3 (dark red), due to its more aggressive looking posture, has a design that tries to use the negative dark space as a way to change its apparent aerodynamics inspired by the F643. The remaining livery for the Challenger Evo (red) was made to be the default <i>digital cruiser</i>, being the livery that incorporates more aspects of the digital identity.</p><p>Ferrari 488 Challenge Evo: 2nd place<br>Ferrari 599XX EVO: 2nd place<br>Ferrari 488 GT3 Evo 2020: 2nd place</p><hr><p class='note'>Note: This project has a really special place for me and in my path as a designer.

The goal was to compile a group of “objects”, being them mostly essays, articles, images or projects, that would reflect upon these questions.<br><br>The project is composed by two artifacts: the book and this website. The book is the main archive, containing the majority of the contents, while the website provides a bridge to the transhumanist culture by providing a lexicon explaining common terms associated with the subjects.<br><br><a class="proj_links" target="blank" href="http://2020.fbaul-dcnm.pt/evolutionary_leap/">→ Project Website</a>',

        text: 'No concelho de Tomar, na freguesia de Madalena, encontramos a aldeia de Cem Soldos, lugar onde, uma vez por ano, a cultura portuguesa é celebrada e partilhada com todos os que a visitam nos dias prometidos. Ao visitar Cem Soldos nos quatro dias eufóricos de verão do festival BONS SONS, a memória que guardei desta aldeia foi a de um movimento permanente, ruas e praças cheias até à claustrofobia, atividade borbulhante que ninguém consegue acompanhar, pontos de cerveja a cada esquina e travessas estreitas utilizadas como vias de passagem de um palco para outro. Sem nunca ter chegado a conhecer este lugar, adivinho que Cem Soldos fica perdido algures no contraste entre a alegria e o desânimo, a agitação e a melancolia, a música e o silêncio. Sem a intervenção do festival transforma-se numa aldeia desconhecida, um espaço lúgubre e tranquilo como todas as outras aldeias.',
