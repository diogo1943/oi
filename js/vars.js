The name Just the Wind came from a Magic the Gathering™ card with the same name. The card name comes to show a moment where we ask &quot;what was it?&quot; and respond with: &quot;nothing, just the wind&quot;.<br><br>This first issue is about humanity and its next stages, how to evolve a society and how we could reach the pinnacle of the human condition. The human being as the center of all the universe, or the possibility that of not ever being...<br><br>With the Wind and the Storm, we want to create a blur between the real insignificance and the insignificance of the real, revealing the big picture as a drama but always keeping in mind that, like it says in the card’s flavor text, &quot;There’s nothing to worry about&quot;.",

        text: 'In the post-digital era, reality and fiction have been diluted. The expression of this lack of definition isn’t limited to just creative and artistic endeavours, but is often weaponized by various power structures, whether formal or informal. This instrumentalization deconstructs core values such as democracy, individual and collective identity, ethnicity, and other fundamental principles of our society.<br><br>Before this current and 	&apos;desirable&apos; identity crisis, design always worked with and for reality. Its objects belong, circulate, and (re)construct reality. The frailty of the majority of communication design objects also contributes to this idea of a practice that &apos;serves&apos; the present. In short, the inevitable shock with reality defines the social status of design. If &apos;design and reality&apos; is a (false) truism, design and fiction might appear to be an improbable hypothesis. In the face of historical, legitimized practices—such as literature or cinema—design now reclaims its place in fiction.<br><br>At the end of another cycle of study in communication design at the Lisbon Faculty of Fine-Arts, we have gone over the dilemmas, the contradictions and the themes that pertain to contemporaneity. Through the projects produced this year, the students have either commented, critiqued or essayed reality, or turned it into fiction. We’ve steered very close to cinema, literature, mythology, but also to the hard truths of a reality that insists on presenting itself, suprising us, and deconstructing itself before our eyes.<br><br><a class="proj_links" target="blank" href="http://ittakesseveralminutes.belasartes.ulisboa.pt/">Project Website →</a>',

Ao visitar Cem Soldos nos quatro dias eufóricos de verão do festival BONS SONS, a memória que guardei desta aldeia foi a de um movimento permanente, ruas e praças cheias até à claustrofobia, atividade borbulhante que ninguém consegue acompanhar, pontos de cerveja a cada esquina e travessas estreitas utilizadas como vias de passagem de um palco para outro. Sem nunca ter chegado a conhecer este lugar, adivinho que Cem Soldos fica perdido algures no contraste entre a alegria e o desânimo, a agitação e a melancolia, a música e o silêncio. Sem a intervenção do festival transforma-se numa aldeia desconhecida, um espaço lúgubre e tranquilo como todas as outras aldeias.',
