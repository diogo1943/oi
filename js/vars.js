        text: "<p><i>Just the Wind</i> is a magazine all about contrasts, the duality of two separate ends, the wind and the storm. The name Just the Wind came from a Magic the Gathering™ card with the same name. The card name comes to show a moment where we ask “what was it?” and respond with: “nothing, just the wind”.</p><p>This first issue is about humanity and its next stages, how to evolve a society and how we could reach the pinnacle of the human condition. The human being as the center of all the universe, or the possibility that of not ever being...</p><p>With the Wind and the Storm, we want to create a blur between the real insignificance and the insignificance of the real, revealing the big picture as a drama but always keeping in mind that, like it says in the card’s flavor text, “There’s nothing to worry about”.</p>",

        text: '<p>In the post-digital era, reality and fiction have been diluted. The expression of this lack of definition isn’t limited to just creative and artistic endeavours, but is often weaponized by various power structures, whether formal or informal. This instrumentalization deconstructs core values such as democracy, individual and collective identity, ethnicity, and other fundamental principles of our society.</p><p>Before this current and 	&apos;desirable&apos; identity crisis, design always worked with and for reality. Its objects belong, circulate, and (re)construct reality. The frailty of the majority of communication design objects also contributes to this idea of a practice that &apos;serves&apos; the present. In short, the inevitable shock with reality defines the social status of design. If &apos;design and reality&apos; is a (false) truism, design and fiction might appear to be an improbable hypothesis. In the face of historical, legitimized practices—such as literature or cinema—design now reclaims its place in fiction.</p><p>At the end of another cycle of study in communication design at the Lisbon Faculty of Fine-Arts, we have gone over the dilemmas, the contradictions and the themes that pertain to contemporaneity. Through the projects produced this year, the students have either commented, critiqued or essayed reality, or turned it into fiction. We’ve steered very close to cinema, literature, mythology, but also to the hard truths of a reality that insists on presenting itself, suprising us, and deconstructing itself before our eyes.</p><p><a class="proj_links" target="blank" href="http://ittakesseveralminutes.belasartes.ulisboa.pt/">→ Project Website</a></p>',

The project is motivated by a renewed interest in fiction, within artistic practices and design in particular, as one of the discursive modes that is best able to restore a sense of reality in an age governed by post-truth. Within this context, the newspaper, as one of the media that most evidently suffered the effects of disinformation, becomes prone to appropriation and recuperation.</p><p>By creatively exploring this publishing model in crisis, The Daily Post-Truth proposes the development of a newspaper, while focusing on the tensions between truth and post-truth, fiction and reality. “The Daily Post-Truth” uses fiction as the basis for a speculative and critical design practice that seeks to question the tenets of the dissemination of disinformation in the post-truth era. The newspaper was developed in a four-day workshop at maat in January 2021, coordinated by António Nicolas, Luísa Ribas and Sofia Gonçalves, with students of the master’s degree in Communication Design: Abel Quental, Beatriz Pinta, Diogo Lourenço and Madalena Lopes.</p>",
